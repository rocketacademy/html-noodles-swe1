    <p><u>PREP TIME</u><br>15 minutes</p>
    <p><u>INGREDIENTS</u>
        <ul>
            <li> 8 oz fresh noodles</li>
            <li> 2 stalks scallions/ green onions, roots trimmed and cut into strips</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon Oyster sauce</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon Soy sauce</li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons Cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>COOKING INSTRUCTIONS
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a wok with the cooking oil until it begins to smoke. Add the scallion strips and stir continuously with the
            spatula until the scallions are aromatic and becomes moderately burned. (This process will release the full fragrance of
            the scallions and infuses the scallion oil with the intense aroma.) Set aside the scallion oil</li>
            <li>Heat up a pot of water until it boils. Cook the fresh noodles al dente. The noodles should be cooked through but still
            somewhat firm and springy. Drain the noodles and transfer into a bowl</li>
            <li>Add the scallion oil, oyster sauce and soy sauce into the noodles. Using a pair of chopsticks, toss the noodles to blend
            well with the scallion oil and seasoning sauces. Serve immediately</li>
        </ol>
